Style files control the formatting and presentation of \LaTeX documents. These are available as \emph{packages} for different journals, institutions, and other applications. 

A WindForS style file has been written to format documents created with the latex \texttt{article}, \texttt{scrartcl}, and \texttt{book} classes. The usual options can still be used with the document classes, including \emph{twocolumn, letterpaper}, and so-on.

Options can be passed to the WindForS style in the preamble:

\begin{lstlisting}
\usepackage[option 1 = true, ..., option n= string]{WindForS}
\end{lstlisting}

Options include:
\begin{description}
\item[blackLinks = true]{make all links the same color as the rest of the body text.}
\item[compactLayout = true]{reduce white space around headings and lists.}
\item[draft = true]{add a `draft' watermark to all pages.}
\item[logo = true]{show the WindForS logo in headers (defaults to true).}
\item[logoPath = ...]{use a specific file for the logo (defaults to \emph{./logo.png}).}
\item[coverLogoPath = ...]{use a specific file for the logo on the front cover of reports (defaults to \emph{./logo\_windfors\_uz\_d\_e.png}).}
\end{description}

The \emph{WindForS} package calls other packages listed in Table \ref{Tab:Packages}. These packages often call other packages, so this is not an exhaustive list.
