PDF/A documents may be required for some applications. These files can be created using the LaTeX PDFx package. 

To do this, add \verb+\usepackage[a-1b]{pdfx}+ \emph{before} \verb+\usepackage[...]{corporate}+, and a file called \texttt{main.xmpdata} with the metadata to the directory where this file is. 

For more details of how to do this, see the tutorial at \href{https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/}{https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/}.

An example of the \texttt{main.xmpdata} file is included with the example article.
