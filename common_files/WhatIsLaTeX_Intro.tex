LaTeX is a mark-up language that describes how a document should be prepared.

Three things are needed to make a LaTeX document:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A source document, usually with extension \emph{.tex}
\item Some packages and classes that help turn what's in the source document into something helpful
\item A compiler, also referred to as a working LaTeX installation. This could be local or web-based, for example at \href{www.overleaf.com}{overleaf.com}.
\end{enumerate}

At first glance the source document looks like a programming language, and that's because it is: LaTeX is not WYSIWYG, like many of the document preparation tools in common use today. A good analogy to LaTeX is html code, which can be read in any text editor but is rendered by web browsers into a finished product.
