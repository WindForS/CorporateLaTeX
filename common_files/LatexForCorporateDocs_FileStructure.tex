Your main file should be called \emph{main.tex}. This helps editors and coauthors identify where to start. Then, use \texttt{input} to import other files into your main file at compilation.

For example, each of the chapters in this report is in separate files, called \emph{WhatIsLatex} (Chapter 1), \emph{LatexForDocs} (Chapter 2), and so-on. In the example available on Github, they are stored in the \emph{files} directory. \emph{main.tex} then looks like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
...
\begin{document}
% content
\input{files/WhatIsLatex}
\input{files/LatexForDocs}
...
\end{lstlisting}
