All fonts should be embedded in the the final PDF. Check the PDF for embedded fonts using a PDF viewer. For example, in Adobe Acrobat Reader, look at the `fonts' tag of the document properties. If any fonts are not shown as being an \emph{embedded subset}, try the conversion again. 

Encapsulated postscript figures are particularly prone to having undefined fonts. Check by compiling the document in draft mode, and seeing if the fonts are still present in the output PDF. To fix this problem, change \emph{.eps} files to \emph{.png} files. To do this `on the fly', use this in the document's preamble:

\begin{lstlisting}
\usepackage{epstopdf}
\epstopdfDeclareGraphicsRule
 {.eps}{png}{.png}{convert eps:\SourceFile.\SourceExt png:\OutputFile}
\AppendGraphicsExtensions{.png}
\end{lstlisting}
